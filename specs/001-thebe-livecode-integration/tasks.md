**Timeline**: +6-8 days (Phase 2C only)  
**Success Criteria**: SC-007, SC-008, SC-010  
**Deployment**: After Phase 2C complete + all SC verified (all 10)

### Parallel Execution Opportunities

- **Phase 0**: All 5 research tasks run in parallel (different team members)
- **Phase 1**: Design tasks (T006-T009) can overlap; data model (T006) needed by contracts (T007)
- **Phase 2A**: 
  - Kernel tasks (T012-T014) run in parallel
  - Frontend tasks (T015-T017) run in parallel (after T012-T014)
  - Testing (T019-T020) must be sequential
- **Phase 2B**:
  - Metadata tasks (T023-T025) run in parallel
  - Fallback tasks (T026-T027) run in parallel
  - Graceful degradation (T028-T029) run in parallel
  - Testing (T030-T032) sequential but can start after T026
- **Phase 2C**:
  - Config tasks (T035-T040) run in parallel
  - Audit + Migration (T042-T044) run in parallel with T035-T041
  - Testing (T045-T048) sequential after config complete
- **Phase 3**: Most tasks can run in parallel (code review, security audit, docs)

**Recommended Parallelization**: 2-3 developers working on Phase 2A simultaneously

## Task Execution Checklist

**Before Starting Any Phase**:
- [ ] Prerequisites for that phase are complete (see dependency graph)
- [ ] Previous phase PR has been reviewed + merged
- [ ] Team understands user stories + acceptance criteria for phase

**For Each Task**:
- [ ] Task description is clear + file paths are specific
- [ ] Developer reads relevant spec sections + quickstart examples
- [ ] Developer creates branch for task (or works on feature branch)
- [ ] Developer completes task implementation
- [ ] Developer writes tests (if applicable) + verifies task works
- [ ] Developer commits with clear message (referencing task ID)
- [ ] Developer opens PR for code review

**After Phase Completion**:
- [ ] All tasks in phase complete
- [ ] All PRs merged to feature branch (`001-thebe-livecode-integration`)
- [ ] All success criteria (SC) verified for phase
- [ ] Team reviews + approves phase completion
- [ ] Phase merged to `001-thebe-livecode-integration` (or main, depending on deployment strategy)

## Notes for Development Team

1. **Constitutional Compliance**: Every task must maintain the 4 core principles (see plan.md). Especially:
   - Keep all content in `/book/`; don't commit to `resources_tif/`
   - Preserve test cells in ejercicios.md (Thebe shouldn't remove them)
   - Ensure all code cells remain executable locally + in browser

2. **Research First**: Phase 0 tasks must complete before Phase 1. Don't skip research; it resolves critical unknowns.

3. **Testing is Mandatory**: Each phase has testing tasks. Don't merge without verifying SC.

4. **Documentation Matters**: Author guides (T021-T022, T033-T034, T051-T052) are part of deliverables. Update them as features are added.

5. **Phased Rollout**: Don't merge all phases at once. Deploy MVP (Phase 2A) first, gather learner feedback, then add features (Phase 2B/C).
