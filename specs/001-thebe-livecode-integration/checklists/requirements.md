# Specification Quality Checklist: Thebe LiveCode Integration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-20  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

---

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) — ✅ All requirements are user/outcome-focused, not tech-specific
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs — ✅ User stories describe learner + author benefits
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders — ✅ Scenarios use plain language ("click Run", "code executes")
- [x] All mandatory sections completed — ✅ Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Assumptions, Constraints, Risks

---

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain — ✅ All requirements are concrete
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous — ✅ Each FR-XXX has clear acceptance criteria
- [x] Success criteria are measurable — ✅ SC-001 through SC-010 include metrics (%, time, satisfaction)
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic — ✅ No mention of "React", "WebAssembly", etc. (except in tech rationale)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined — ✅ 5 user stories × 4-5 scenarios each = 20+ test cases
- [x] Edge cases are identified — ✅ 4 edge cases documented (file writes, memory, WASM support, CORS)
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded — ✅ Python only, Pyodide-based, browser-first
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified — ✅ Blocker: Jupyter Book 1.0+; Assumption: WASM support

---

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria — ✅ FR-001 to FR-015 tied to user stories
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows — ✅ P1 (MVP): execute + mark cells; P2: dependencies + fallbacks; P3: config
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes — ✅ SC-001-SC-010 define success
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification — ✅ Spec focuses on WHAT, not HOW

## Validation Results

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers | ✅ PASS | Spec is complete and specific |
| All sections complete | ✅ PASS | Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Constraints, Risks present |
| 5+ user stories with independent tests | ✅ PASS | P1 (2 stories), P2 (2), P3 (1) — each independently testable |
| Measurable success criteria | ✅ PASS | 10 criteria with specific metrics |
| No implementation bias | ✅ PASS | Technology-agnostic language throughout |
| Scope boundaries clear | ✅ PASS | Python only, browser-first, Pyodide-based |
